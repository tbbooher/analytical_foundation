  %p
    The purpose of this site is for the analysts of AF/A9 and friends to keep our analytical spears sharp.
    We are currently focused on learning Radars.
  %p A small group of us have decided we’ll try to establish lunchtime seminars to learn/review/discuss RADAR and eventually other core competencies.  Any/all of you are welcome to join us.  Per our discussions today, we plan for our next seven sessions to cover the following topics:

  %ol
    %li 27 Oct - RADAR Range Equation
    %li 3 Nov - Parameter Estimation
    %li 10 Nov - Waveform Design
    %li 17 Nov - Detection Theory
    %li 1 Dec - Clutter, Multipath
    %li 8 Dec - Key RADAR Components
    %li 15 Dec - Electronic Attack/Electronic Protection

  %p Tim Booher will send out a few problems or tasks related to the weekly topic NLT the Monday prior to our session, and we will all try to get together on Thursday to share our experiences/challenges/epiphanies.  After session 7 we will move onto different topics, intending to work our way through some set of “core knowledge” that our fearless leader (Mike) would like for us to understand/master.  If you don’t manage to complete the task/problems, don’t let that dissuade you from attending on Thursday.  The interaction and discussion is most important.  The Lincoln Lab lecture series and RADAR tutorial websites below and the Merrill Skolnik Introduction to RADAR Systems text are our core resources, but please share any other materials/links that you find useful.

  %p This is a follow-up to Tim Booher’s “Let’s Learn RADAR” proposal:  “I propose we go through the first lesson in this course <http://www.ll.mit.edu/workshops/education/videocourses/introradar/lecture1/lecture.html>  on our own. Then we meet at 1500 next Friday and discuss, break into teams and spend an hour going through relevant problems. As we go through the course, let’s ask questions and create an atmosphere of dialogue <http://www.thefreedictionary.com/show+off> .”

  %p Tim had asked Bill Todd to come up with some questions/problems we could work through in order to help set the first lesson’s material firmly in our minds.  We’ll also use this session as a kick-off to discuss how we want to do this in the future.  (Many of us have the Skolnik text on our desk, so maybe we work through that with the MIT lectures and materials like http://www.radartutorial.eu/01.basics/rb04.en.html as supplements.  Again, anyone who wants to join us is invited.
